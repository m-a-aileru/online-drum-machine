# Online Drum Machine

It speaks for itself. It is basically an online drum pad that contains a few basic drum kit sounds for you to play around with.

## Installation

It is currently an online web app, so no installation needed. Just go to (https://tinyurl.com/online-drum-machine) and have fun.

## Usage

Press any number from 1-8 to play the corresponding drum sound (or click the keypads using your mouse).

Press '1' for the bass/kick drum.

Press '2' for the snare drum.

Press '3' for the high tom drum.

Press '4' for the mid tom drum.

Press '5' for the floor/low tom drum.

Press '6' for the hi-hat cymbals.

Press '7' for the ride cymbal.

Press '8' for the crash cymbal.

## Roadmap

This project is currently in it's early stages and is somewhat usable but there is definitely room for a lot more improvement. Future ideas are listed below:

- Ability for users to customise elements of the interface, such as the colour scheme, layout of the pads, etc
- Room for users to change a load in different drum sounds and maybe even drum kits
- Ability for users to record their own drum loops

## Contributing

This project is not currently open to contributions but it might be sometime in the future, so watch this space.

## Authors and acknowledgment

Have to thank me (Matthew Aileru), myself (Matthew Aileru) and I (Matthew Aileru) for this. Honestly, where would this project be without those three, eh?
